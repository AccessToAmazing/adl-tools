<h2>Specialisation Semantics</h2>
The workbench now works using two
kinds of files: differential 'source' files (.adls extension) and flat
files (.adl extension). Previously, .adl files were treated as the
source of all archetypes. However, they are not an appropriate source
form representation for specialised archetypes. Instead, a differential
representation is used, rather like specialised classes in object
oriented programming languages. The consequences of this change are as
follows:<br />
<ul>
  <li>specialised archetypes will be far more
sustainable to author, as they will no longer contain copies of
structural parts inherited from parent archetypes;</li>
  <li>there are now two kinds of files:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">.adls file</span>: this will become the 'source' file type for all archetypes.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">.adl file</span>:
this will become the file type for&nbsp;the 'flat' &nbsp;view of an archetype. In
the future, .adl files will no longer be stored, but will be generated
on the fly.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>for existing archetype repositories consisting
of .adl files, the .adl file will be treated as the initial source. A
.adls file will be generated once only for each .adl file, and from
then on, the .adls file will be used as the source.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compiler Mode of Operation</h2>
The Archetype workbench now functions as a compiler over the entire
archteype 'directory' (the merged result of the reference and work
repositories). With a single command (F7; build repository), all
archetypes are compiled, and an error report built up which can be
perused at any time. Slot relationships between archetypes are now
shown, as are statistics for the repositories.<br />
<h2>Status of Tooling</h2>
<span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Currently
the tooling is in a proof-of-concept state with respect to
specialisation. Some further small changes are needed to complete the
semantics, including being able to specify ordering of branches in
specialised archetypes.</span><br style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;" />
<br style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;" />
<span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">The
current release of the tool will not overwrite any .adl files, it will
just silently create .adls files. These can be removed via the 'Clean
Generated Files'&nbsp;option on the Tools menu.</span>

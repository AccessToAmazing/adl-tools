        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>The 1.5 release of the ADL (Archetype Definition Language) formalism, and its object model counterpart, the
        AOM (Archetype Object Model) is a major advance on the previous 1.4 release. It fixes a number of problems with
        ADL/AOM 1.4, provides a unified formalism for both archetypes and templates, and adds a number of useful new
        features. These help pages don&#39;t attempt to provide the pedagogic basis of the formalism, which can be
        found in the specifications, rather it illustrates each feature of the ADL/AOM 1.5 formalism with real examples
        you can see for yourself. The specifications are found in the following locations.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The Archetype Definition Language 1.5 (draft)</li>

          <li>The Archetype Object Model 1.5 (draft)</li>

          <li><i>open</i>EHR Distributed Knowledge Development (draft)</li>

          <li><i>open</i>EHR Distributed Artefact Identification System (draft)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These specifications are currently in late draft (Aug 2010) and are expected to be released as Trial
        Specifications in the near future. Although most of the principal features have been determined and implemented, there remain a number of details which could be changed; these are indicated in the text below. Your feedback on any aspect of the specification is encourage, and can be reported on the <font color="#FF0000">openEHR SPEC_PR Jira project</font>. Please create new issues with the 'ADL 1.5' component specified.</p>

        <p>The remainder of this page describes the configuration of the tool for viewing the examples, and then
        describes in turn each of the features of ADL/AOM 1.5 grouped in the categories &#39;New features&#39; and
        &#39;Changes&#39;.</p>

        <h2>Set-up</h2>

        <p>In order to work with the examples described below, the following configuration is advised. Experienced
        users may skip this step.</p>

        <h3>Repository setup</h3>

        <p>You should download the CKM and the <i>open</i>EHR test archetype repositories. The steps to do this are as
        follows.</p>

        <p>For the Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM) repository:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Login to the repository at <a href=
          "http://www.openEHR.org/knowledge">http://www.openehr.org/knowledge</a>.</li>

          <li>Go to XXX &gt; XXX and select all archetypes for download; save in any location. For the purposes of this
          manual, we will refer to the location as $CKM.</li>

          <li>In the AWB, select Repository &gt; Set Repository</li>

          <li>On the dialog, use the large &#39;+&#39; button to add a new profile called &#39;CKM&#39;.</li>

          <li>Set the Reference repository to $CKM, as described above.</li>

          <li>Save the new profile.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <i>open</i>EHR test archetype repository is a Subversion repository located <a href=
        "http://www.openehr.org/svn/knowledge2/TRUNK">here</a>. If you have a Subversion client such as TortoiseSVN
        installed on your machine, use it to check out this repository. If you do not have a Subversion tool, you can
        download the repository as a .zip file from <a href="http://www.openehr.org/wsvn/knowledge2/TRUNK">this
        page</a>. We will refer to the location of this repository on your file system as $knowledge2. Now, there is
        actually more than one logical group of archetypes in the repository, so the configuration is as follows.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>In the AWB, select Repository &gt; Set Repository.</li>

          <li>On the dialog, use the large &#39;+&#39; button to add a new profile called &#39;ADL 1.5 test&#39; or
          similar.</li>

          <li>Set the Reference repository to $knowledge2/archetypes/ADL_1.5_test.</li>

          <li>Save the new profile.</li>

          <li>Repeat the above steps and create another new profile called &#39;openEHR examples&#39; or similar.</li>

          <li>Set the Reference Repository to
          $knowledge2/archetypes/openEHR_examples/demographic_template/Reference.</li>

          <li>Set the Work Repository to $knowledge2/archetypes/openEHR_examples/demographic_template/Working.</li>

          <li>Save the new profile.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are interested in EN 13606, you can use the above method to create a further profile called
        &#39;EN13606 examples&#39; or similar, using the Reference Repository path
        $knowledge2/archetypes/en13606_examples.</p>

		<h3>RM Schemas</h3>
        <p>You will need to have all the relevant RM schemas selected for these profiles to work. Assuming you have
        followed the above instructions, you do this as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Select Tools &gt; Options</li>

          <li>Ensure that the openehr, adltest, and en13606 (if relevant) schemas are checked, as shown <a href=
          "images/options_rm_schema_config.png">here</a>.</li>

          <li>Save the configuration.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can now use the Repository &gt; Set Repository dialog to switch between the profiles at will. The remaining sections below describe how to see the ADL/AOM 1.5 changes using the archetypes you have configured above.</p>

        <h2>ADL/AOM 1.5 - New features</h2>

        <h3>artefact_type marker</h3>

        <p>A new attribute has been added to the ARCHETYPE class to enable various instantiations of the AOM to be
        designated as having different design intention - &#39;archetype&#39;, &#39;template&#39;,
        &#39;template_component&#39;, &#39;operational_template&#39;. This allows ADL/AOM being used for archetypes,
        and various forms of templates.</p>
		
		<p>You can see this feature as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Choose the <b>openEHR_Examples</b> profile</li>
		<li>In the archetype explorer, navigate to any archetype, e.g. CLUSTER/person_additional_data_br</li>
		<li>Choose the 'Differential' tab (top set of tabs)</li>
		<li>Choose the 'Source' tab (second row of tabs); the keyword 'archetype' appears at the start of the first line of the file.</li>
		<li>Now navigate to the PERSON.t_patient_simple template in the template explorer</li>
		<li>When it has compiled, you will see the 'template' keyword in its source view</li>
		<li>Navigate to one of its children. You will see the keyword 'template_component' in its source view.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Via the above method, you have been viewing the archetype and template ADL source files. Of course normally you don't need to do this to understand what kind of artefact you are looking at - the explorer icons are specific to each type.</p>

        <h3>Path-based constraints for specialised archetypes and templates</h3>

        <p>All specialised archetypes and templates state their constraints in a &#39;differential form&#39; whereby new or changed elements of an archetype are defined using blocks of ADL (or XML, in the XML format) under a path. The following example is typical:</p>
        <pre>
            EVALUATION[at0000.1] matches { -- Diagnosis
                /data/items[at0002.1]/value matches
                    DV_CODED_TEXT matches {...}
                }
             }
</pre>

        <p>This deceptively simple enhancement to ADL/AOM ensures that specialised archetypes and templates can now be properly represented and maintained by tools, compared to the current situation where specialised archetypes contain copies of elements from the parent artefact. You can see some examples of this, as follows.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Select the <b>CKM</b> profile</li>
		<li>Navigate in the archetype explorer to CONTENT_ITEM/CARE_ENTRY/EVALUATION/problem/diagnosis, and select the diagnosis node, which corresponds to the archetype openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.problem-diagnosis.v1</li>
		<li>Select the 'Differential' tab, and below it, the 'Node map' tab, you should see <a href="images/problem-diagnosis_diff_view.png">this</a></li>
		<li>You will see that below the top 'Diagnosis' node, the path '/data[at0001]/items' appears, and below that, one redefined object node and two new object node constraints.</li>
		<li>Now select the 'flat' tab, to see how these constraints have been correctly integrated into the structure defined by the parent archetype openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.problem.v1, as shown <a href="images/problem-diagnosis_flat_view.png">here</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can also use the 'Source' tab to see the path-based constraints in their source form. You can now navigate through the hierarchies in the archetype explorer, looking for specialised archetypes (any archetype whose parent is another archetype rather than a class), whose constraints all use the path-based definition method illustrated above. The CONTENT_ITEM/CARE_ENTRY/OBSERVATION/lab-test hierarchy for example contains numerous specialised archetypes.</p>

        <h3>&#39;before&#39; and &#39;after&#39; keywords for item ordering in containers</h3>

        <p>The &#39;before&#39; and &#39;after&#39; keywords can be used to specify the ordering of elements added to a
        container in a specialised archetype or template. This ensures authors can maintain ordering of all items
        within container attributes, including over specialisation.</p>
		
		<p>If you refer back to the problem-diagnosis example above in the <a href="images/problem-diagnosis_diff_view.png">differential form</a>, you will see that the second two nodes include 'before' and 'after' markers respectively. The former is 'before [at0003]' and the latter 'after [at0031]', indicating the nodes from the parent archetype with respect to which the new nodes should be situated. If you now choose the Flat view, with RM visibility (radio buttons on the right) set to '+ class names', you will see that these two nodes are indeed situation in the correct positions with respect to the referenced nodes, as seen <a href="images/problem-diagnosis_flat+RM_view.png">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>&#39;generated&#39; marker</h3>

        <p>Used to indicate that the artefact was generated by software, rather than authored by hand. This flag will appear on any differential (.adls file extension) archetype converted from a legacy (pre-1.5) archetype (.adl extension). In addition, any generated flat form archetype (.adlf file) carries this marker. The flag primarily allows tools to detect that a source form archetype (i.e. any .adls file or its XML equivalent) was generated from a legacy file rather than an authored artefact.</p>
        <p>Most archetypes in the CKM repository when view in their Differential Source form (Differential and Source tabs) include the 'generated' marked in the top line. By contrast, none of the archetypes in the ADL_1.5_test or openEHR_example repositories contain differential archetypes with the 'generated' marker.</p>

        <h3>Exclusion of object constraints</h3>

        <p>Object constraints can be excluded, enabling templates to choose which constraints to retain for the use case of the template. Exclusion is also legal for archetypes, but is likely to be unexpected, and it is recommended that tools either prevent it or include a very clear confirmation dialog for the author. There are three ways to effect exclusion.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Any attribute - complete removal</b>: if the attribute in the flat parent has existence matches {0..1}, then it is optional and can be completely removed in a specialised child. To see an example of this, follow these steps:
		<ul>
		<li><font color="#FF0000">TBD</font></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Single-valued attribute - remove alternative(s)</b>: if a single-valued attribute has multiple alternative optional constraints defined in the flat parent archetype (occurrences matches {0..1}, {0..*} etc), any of these may be redefined to {0}, i.e. occurrences of zero. To see an example of this, follow these steps:
		<ul>
		<li><font color="#FF0000">TBD</font></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Multiply-valued attribute - remove child</b>: in exactly the same way as for single-valued attributes, any optional child of a multiply-valued (container) attribute may be removed by redefining its occurrences to {0}. To see an example of this, follow these steps:
			<ul>
			<li>Select <b>openEHR_examples</b> profile in the usual manner</li>
			<li>Navigate to the PERSON.t_patient_simple template in the template explorer and select it (click once)</li>
			<li>Still in the template explorer, open out the first sub-part of the template (the one marked /details[at0001]/items) and select the child CLUSTER.t_birth_data. You can now view the exclusions in various ways:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>In the central archetype view area, select the 'Differential' view Node map with RM visibility = 'Hide', you should see <a href="images/occ_redef_0_simple_view.png">this</a></li>
				<li>Now change the RM visibility to '+ classes', you should see <a href="images/occ_redef_0_RM_view.png">this</a></li>
				<li>Now select the 'Source' view you should see <a href="images/occ_redef_0_source_view.png">this</a></li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>

        <h3><font color="#FF0000">Negation operator to express exclusions (Not yet implemented)</font></h3>

        <p>In specialised archetypes and templates, unneeded elements from primitive type ranges / value sets in the parent artefact can be logically be removed using the !matches (&isin; <font color="#FF0000">code for negated version</font>) operator. This provides a way to convenient way to remove a small number of items from a large list.</p>

        <h3>Archetype - archetype external reference</h3>

        <p>The new C_ARCHETYPE_ROOT class in the AOM allows an archetype to refer to another archetype, without having to use a slot.
        Also used to perform slot-filling in templates. Supports archetype refactoring and reuse, as well as template
        slot-filling.</p>

        <h3>Slot redefinition semantics, including slot-filling</h3>

        <p>The semantics of redefining archetype slots in specialised archetypes and templates is now stated;
        slot-filling is regarded as a part of redefinition. This allows templates to be formally considered as being
        the same as specialised archetypes. Templates can now be represented using the AOM/ADL formalism rather than a
        separate formalism.</p>

        <h3>Annotations section (Not yet implemented)</h3>

        <p>Annotations can now be added on a per-node basis, with each annotation having one or more facets
        (representation = Hash&lt;T&gt;). This supports fine-grained documentation of elements of archetypes and
        templates.</p>

        <h3>Default values (Not yet implemented)</h3>

        <p>The AOM now allows default values to be included on any node. This feature supports default value setting in
        templates.</p>

        <h3>Passthrough node flag (Not yet implemented)</h3>

        <p>The AOM now includes a &#39;passthrough&#39; flag on C_COMPLEX_OBJECT indicating that this node is not
        significant in terms of display. Allows nodes required for structuring data but otherwise redundant for screen
        display and reporting to be detected by rendering software.</p>

        <h3>Reference model subtype matching semantics</h3>

        <p>Specialised archetypes and templates can now redefine the reference model type of a node, e.g. DV_TEXT into
        DV_CODED_TEXT. Allows free text constraints to be changed to coded-only constraints.</p>

        <h3>Node congruence &amp; conformance semantics</h3>

        <p>Rules have now been defined for determining if a node in a specialised artefact is conformant (consistent)
        or congruent (the same as) a corresponding node in the parent. This allows proper validation of specialised
        archetypes and templates to be implemented.</p>

        <h3>Operational template object model</h3>

        <p>The object model of an operational template is now defined. A formal specification is now available for
        tooling to use, and for use in software environments.</p>

        <h3>Flattening semantics for operational templates</h3>

        <p>The rules for generating an operational template from source template &amp; archetypes are now defined. This
        means that tools can implement a reliable transform from source artefacts to the operational artefact.</p>

        <h3>Group construct (Not yet implemented)</h3>

        <p>This feature supports groups within container attributes. Original proposal on this page.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>

        <h3>Existence and cardinality are now optional</h3>

        <p>Due to reference model checking, the ADL 1.4 semantics of mandatory defaults for existence and cardinality
        have been removed; now the reference model is always used to determine the underlying existence and cardinality
        of an attribute. Archetypes and templates now only carry existence and cardinality if it is different from the
        reference model.</p>

        <h3>Rules for at-codes</h3>

        <p>Rules have been stated for when at-codes need to be specialised, according to the changes stated in the
        specialised artefact. Editing tools can determine correct node ids in specialised artefacts.</p>

        <h3>Invariants and declarations merged into rules</h3>

        <p>A single &#39;rules&#39; section is now used to contain invariant and declaration statements, which define
        constraints over multiple nodes in the artefact. The formalism and model of rules has been substantially
        improved. Simplifies overall artefact structure; allows constraints to refer to external entities, such as
        patient data, time etc.</p>

        <h3>Terminology_extract section added to Ontology (Not yet implemented)</h3>

        <p>A terminology_extract sub-section is now included in the ontology section of an archetype, enabling codes
        &amp; rubrics from terminology to be included. Mostly used for templates. Templates can directly include small
        extracts of external terminologies, making them standalone for such value-sets.</p>

        <h3>Representation for ref set reference (Not yet implemented)</h3>

        <p>A final addition is needed to either the AOM or the openEHR Profile model, of a class that defines how to
        represent a resolved reference to an external terminology; this class would replace a CONSTRAINT_REF node from
        a source template in an operational template. The benefit is that external ref-set references will be resolved
        in an operational template.</p>

        <h3>Semantic slot type (Not yet implemented)</h3>

        <p>See this sub-page for a discussion on the advanced semantics of slots, and how it simplifies templates.</p>

        <h3>node ids for C_DV_QUANTITY in ADL (Not yet implemented)</h3>

        <p>Currently we cannot put a node-id on a dADL node like a C_DV_QUANTITY, or a special syntax node, like
        C_DV_ORDINAL or C_CODE_PHRASE. This does not affect the AOM or XML serialised form.</p>

        <h3>Rules syntax (Xpath-based) (TODO)</h3>

        <p>TBD</p>

        <h3>Node_id optionality</h3>

        <p>Currently node_id is specified as mandatory on all nodes. However, this is not semantically needed, and
        creates unnecessarily long paths which don&#39;t map cleanly to the equivalent XML Xpaths. ADL 1.5 defines
        precise rules for when node_ids are mandatory.</p>

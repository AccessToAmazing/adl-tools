<h2>Changes</h2>



This ADL 1.5 preview release of the workbench includes the following changes:<br />

<ul>

  <li>performs
stricter validation than previous versions, now reporting 40 syntax
errors, 47 validity errors, and 4 validity warnings.</li>

  <li>Errors are more clearly differentiated into the following categories:</li>

  
  <ul>

    <li>syntax error: the file is not valid ADL - shown in red</li>

    <li>validity
error: the archetype semantics are not valid when validated against
parent archetypes and the reference model - shown in orange</li>

    <li>validity warning: the semantics are valid, but there are redundant elements or other small issues to correct - shown in yellow</li>

    <li>passed - shown in green</li>

  
  </ul>

</ul>

<h2>New features</h2>



This release includes the following new features:<br />

<ul>

  <li>it now uses the reference model (RM) to validate all archetypes.
The reference model is currently expressed in a custom meta-model
format which is much simpler than UML 2 based meta-models, e.g. XMI.
The meta-model can be found at
    <a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/BRANCHES/specialisation/apps/adl_workbench/app/rm_schema.dadl">http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/BRANCHES/specialisation/apps/adl_workbench/app/rm_schema.dadl</a>
. Both the location of this file, and its design may change in the
future, and its current format should not be taken as normative for
openEHR.</li>

  <li>RM attributes are now shown in the node map visualisation (<a href="images/rm_differential.png">differential form</a>, <a href="images/rm_flat.png">flattened form</a>). In the
differential view, only attributes defined on the concrete class
mentioned in the archetype are shown; in the flat view, all inherited
attributes are shown.</li>

  <li>A new&nbsp;test has been added to the test page that allows
original ADL fles to be overwritten with the result of the flattening
operation on archetypes. THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL and should be used with
care - it will really overwrite ADL files, so be sure to use it in a
version-controlled context, such as SVN (where you can conveniently
then see diffs of the files). For this reason, both the 'Save ADL' and
'Save ADLS' tests now require checkboxes to be checked before they will
operate. The intention of the new 'Save ADL' operation is to experiment
with removal of some kinds of errors from legacy ADL fles.</li>

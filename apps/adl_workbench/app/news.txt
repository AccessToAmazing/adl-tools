User interface improvements:
* The Errors and Slots tabs now show how many archetypes appear within them.
* The repository explorer shows if an archetype has slots or is used by another archetype. 

These problems in the previous release are now fixed:
* On Linux and Mac only:
  * Opening an archetype ad-hoc did not show it in the explorer tree.
  * Double-clicking an archetype in the Errors or Slots tabs did not show it in the explorer tree.

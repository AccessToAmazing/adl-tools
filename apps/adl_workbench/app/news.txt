ADL_WORKBENCH NEWS (see Help menu > News)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality:
* Export Repository Report option generates an XML file of statistics and errors.
* Edit gives the choice of either the .adls or .adl file.
* Edit gives a configurable choice of multiple editors, including the Archetype Editor.
* The parser detects duplicates and missing assumed values in ordinals and coded text.

User interface improvements:
* The Errors and Slots tabs now show how many archetypes appear within them.
* The repository explorer shows a little arrow next to each archetype that has slots.

These problems in the previous release are now fixed:
* The dADL parser did not accept parentheses around type identifiers.
* Term bindings were grouped by terminology name and version rather than just by terminology name.
* In the Flat view of a specialised archetype, attribute paths were missing.
* On the Statistics tab, the Slots counts were not updated correctly.
* Clicking the Parse button did not re-parse an already-parsed archetype, despite the user editing the ADL file.
* On Linux and Mac only:
  * Opening an archetype ad-hoc did not show it in the explorer tree.
  * Double-clicking an archetype in the Errors or Slots tabs did not show it in the explorer tree.

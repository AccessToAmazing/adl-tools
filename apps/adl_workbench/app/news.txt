The GUI has been improved to behave better on different screens. 
A major addition for batch testing has been made to the tool.

Archetype Merging
-----------------
The left-hand explorer tree now merges archetypes from a reference 
repository and an optional work repository. This facilitates working with
local archetypes based on existing archetypes, e.g. as defined in the
openEHR knowledge repository at http://svn.openEHR.org/knowledge.

Node map Visualisation Now Shows Inheritance Status
---------------------------------------------------
The node visualisation of the definition of an archetype now indicates the
inheritance status of each node. In specialised archetypes, some nodes will
show up as inherited, some redefined and some as added new in the archetype.
In a top-level archetype, all nodes are shown as added new. The 
visualisation can be toggled on and off. When an archetype is first shown,
inherited nodes will be collapsed, with only redefined or added nodes
expanded.

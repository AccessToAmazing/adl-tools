ADL_WORKBENCH NEWS (see Help menu > News)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADL Workbench is now available for:
* Linux
* Windows
* Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard 

Differential archetypes:
* A new differential form of archetype implements the specialisation semantics partially documented in the openEHR Archetype Semantics PDF.
* The Repository menu has options to build (i.e. parse and validate) the whole or part of the repository tree.
* Each archetype's icon in the repository tree indicates its build status.
* The new Errors list at the bottom shows all errors and warnings while building.
* Files with the new .adls (ADL Source) extension contain the differential form of archetype.
* The .adls files are auto-generated, during building, from the old .adl files.
* The .adls file, if it exists, is read in preference to the old .adl file.
* The old .adl file is thereafter considered an auto-generated flat form of the archetype.
* For this release only, to smooth the transition from .adl to .adls, the Tools menu has an option to clean all of the generated .adls files from the repository. 

Other new functionality:
* Opening an archetype ad hoc now grafts it into the repository explorer.
* Basic repository-wide Statistics are now displayed.
* HTML is generated via an explicit menu option (not as a by-product of the Test view) into its own tree (not side-by-side with the ADL source files).
* The Definition tab has two new sub-tabs to show the archetype's slots, as well as which other archetypes it is used by.
* Duration units and interval can now be constrained both at the same time. 

User interface improvements:
* The Options dialog is now accessed via a Windows-standard Tools menu.
* In the Options dialog, you can choose to hide the line numbers in the Source text.
* The Save combo box on the tool bar has been replaced by a choice in the Save As dialog.
* Usability via the keyboard and the mouse wheel has been improved.
* Specialisation domain concepts are displayed more simply in the repository explorer.
* In the Test view, you can select and deselect entire sub-hierarchies of archetypes.
* The splash screen is improved in appearance; it shows sooner and it disappears as soon as the main window is shown.
* The application's version number now has a fourth part, identifying the revision from which it was built.
* The application icon is now the openEHR logo. 

These problems in the previous release are now fixed:
* Unicode occasionally displayed wrongly in the Node Map.
* On Mac OS X:
  * The splitter jumped to the left edge of the window, hiding the repository tree.
  * The mouse pointer became a white square after clicking the repository explorer.
  * Some controls were difficult to use and some captions were hard to read because they were too small.
  * The Edit and Online Help options did not work with the default configuration.

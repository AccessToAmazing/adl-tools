ADL WORKBENCH NEWS (see Help menu > News)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved functionality:
* Greater validation is performed.
* Errors are more clearly categorised

New functionality:
* Reference Model checking - turn on via the Tools > Options dialog
* Reference Model visualisation - turn on via the 'RM visible' checkbox in the Node ap tab.

The reference model definition is in the application install directory, file rm_schema.dadl. The
format and location of this file may change in the future due to the direction developed for
machine-representable models in the openEHR community.

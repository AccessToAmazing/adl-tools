ADL WORKBENCH NEWS (see Help menu > News)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPROVED FUNCTIONALITY
* Greater validation is performed.
* Errors are more clearly categorised
* Various errors in the inheritance flattening functionality have been fixed

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
* Reference Model checking
* Reference Model visualisation - turn on via the 'RM visible' checkbox in the Node Map tab
* Ability to save out flattened ADL archetypes. The ADL version of the output format can be 
  controlled via a setting in the .cfg file, called adl_version_for_flat_output. This could be 
  set as follows: 
  	adl_version_for_flat_output=1.4
  If this is not set, the default output version will be 1.5. The main differences setting of 1.4
  enables is removal of () around C_DV_QUANTITY and other dADL sections, and also the 'generated'
  keyword is not output. This would allow such archetypes to be processed by non-ADL 1.5 compliant
  tools.

  WARNING: this option should preferably be used in a Subversion work area or similar situation
	where previous versions can be reverted to if required. 
	
The reference model definition is in the application install directory, file rm_schema.dadl. The
format and location of this file may change in the future due to the direction developed for
machine-representable models in the openEHR community.

for help.

LIMITATIONS
  The current .adl differencing algorithm (generates .adls from a .adl file and its 
  specialisation parent) is not perfect, and occasionally misses redefinitions on leaf nodes
  not having any higher node with a redefined node id. The consequence is that the .adls
  generated in such situations is not always guaranteed to be lossless with respect to the 
  legacy .adl file from which it was generated. This problem affects a very small number of 
  archetypes, and is being worked on.

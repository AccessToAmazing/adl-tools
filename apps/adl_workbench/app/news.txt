ADL_WORKBENCH NEWS (see Help menu > News)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality:
* Specialised archetypes are now represented keyed by path.
* Much greater validation is performed.

These problems in the previous release are now fixed:
* Previously, the oldest version of any given archetype was picked up, now the newest is 
  instead.

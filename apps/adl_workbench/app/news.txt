ADL WORKBENCH NEWS (see Help menu > News)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved functionality:
* Greater validation is performed.
* Errors are more clearly categorised
* Various errors in the inheritance flattening functionality have been fixed

New functionality:
* Reference Model checking - turn on via the Tools > Options dialog
* Reference Model visualisation - turn on via the 'RM visible' checkbox in the Node Map tab
* Ability to save out flattened ADL archetypes. The ADL version of the output format can be 
  controlled via a setting in the .cfg file, called adl_version_for_flat_output. This could be 
  set as follows: 
  	adl_version_for_flat_output=1.4
  If this is not set, the default output version will be 1.5. The main differences setting of 1.4
  enables is removal of () around C_DV_QUANTITY and other dADL sections, and also the 'generated'
  keyword is not output. This would allow such archetypes to be processed by non-ADL 1.5 compliant
  tools.

The reference model definition is in the application install directory, file rm_schema.dadl. The
format and location of this file may change in the future due to the direction developed for
machine-representable models in the openEHR community.

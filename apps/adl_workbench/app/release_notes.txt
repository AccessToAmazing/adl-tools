ADL WORKBENCH Release Notes
===========================

---------- 11 August 2010 ADL/AOM 1.5 beta release ----------
SVN http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/BRANCHES/specialisation - rev 1104

NEW in this release
	o Support for 90% of ADL 1.5 specification, including validity codes
	o Support for ADL 1.5 templates including visualisation
	o strict and non-strict ADL 1.5 modes; non-strict warns and removes duplicate existence and cardinality
	o specialised archetype/template identifiers no longer have to include parent identifier
	o Support for multiple reference model schemas (Tools > Options)
	o Archetype files can now be arranged anywhere on the file-system; compiler uses RM and 
	  specialisation relationships to build directory in tool;
	o availability of a draft EN13606 schema
	o support for multiple repository profiles (Repository > Set Repository)
	o test page now generates archetypes pre- and post- compiling to show differences
	o user preferences file now in correct operating system location (e.g. Users/<user>/appdata on Windows 7)


See http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/BRANCHES/specialisation/apps/doc/web/index.html for help.

	o ADL 1.5 test archetypes - http://www.openehr.org/svn/knowledge2/TRUNK


------------ 22 March 2009 ADL/AOM 1.5 Preview Release ------------
SVN http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/BRANCHES/specialisation - rev 851

CHANGES

    o performs stricter validation than previous versions, now reporting 40 syntax errors, 47 validity 
      errors, and 4 validity warnings.
    o Errors are more clearly differentiated into the following categories:
          o syntax error: the file is not valid ADL - shown in red
          o validity error: the archetype semantics are not valid when validated against parent 
            archetypes and the reference model - shown in orange
          o validity warning: the semantics are valid, but there are redundant elements or other 
            small issues to correct - shown in yellow
          o passed - shown in green

NEW
    o it now uses the reference model (RM) to validate all archetypes. The reference model is currently 
      expressed in a custom meta-model format which is much simpler than UML 2 based meta-models, e.g. XMI. 
      The meta-model can be found at       
	  http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/BRANCHES/specialisation/apps/adl_workbench/app/rm_schema.dadl . 
      Both the location of this file, and its design may change in the future, and its current format should 
      not be taken as normative for openEHR.
    o RM attributes are now shown in the node map visualisation (differential form, flattened form). In the 
      differential view, only attributes defined on the concrete class mentioned in the archetype are shown;
      in the flat view, all inherited attributes are shown.
    o A new test has been added to the test page that allows original ADL fles to be overwritten with the 
      result of the flattening operation on archetypes. THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL and should be used with care - 
      it will really overwrite ADL files, so be sure to use it in a version-controlled context, such as SVN 
      (where you can conveniently then see diffs of the files). For this reason, both the 'Save ADL' and 
      'Save ADLS' tests now require checkboxes to be checked before they will operate. The intention of the 
      new 'Save ADL' operation is to experiment with removal of some kinds of errors from legacy ADL fles.

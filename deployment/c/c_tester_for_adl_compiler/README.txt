	This simple C project illustrates the use of the Eiffel static library 
	form of the adl_compiler, created by the Eiffel project in the sibling 
	directory adl_compiler. Follow the instructions found there and take
	the resulting .lib or .a file and copy it into the current directory.

	The current Makefile has been develped for Windows/VC++. If you are 
	working on another platform and/or compiler, you will need a different
	Makefile.
